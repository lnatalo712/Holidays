# Holidays

This project was created in order to manage a list of holidays from 2020 to 2024. The main programming for the prject can be found in Holiday Manager.py, the starting list of holidays can be found in holidays.json, and the output of the updated list of holidays can be found in HolidaysList.json.

Within Holiday Manager.py the user has the ability to add holidays to the list, remove holidays from the list, view any week within the list, and save the list to a new json file. This project also makes use of web scraping to gather a more exhaustive list of holidays, and a weather forecast API to provide the forecast for the current week.
